# Purpose:
- Built a machine learning model utilizing XGBoost Classifier to predict Parkinson's disease with a mean accuracy score of 87.63%

# Technique Used:
- Explored correlations between variables and their importance to the target variable using Pythonâ€™s Seaborn library
- Simplified the dataset using custom function to remove highly collinear variables that could reduce computational expense.

# Note:
We are able to remove 11 out of 24 features without significantly affect the performance of the model. It is hard to tell if the model is highly effective because the dataset is too small. It is probable that the model is overfitting or underfitting the data.
