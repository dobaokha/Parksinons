Purpose:
- Built a machine learning model utilizing XGBoost Classifier to predict Parkinson's disease with a mean accuracy score of 87.63%

Technique Used:
- Explored correlations between variables and their importance to the target variable using Pythonâ€™s Seaborn library
- Simplified the dataset using custom function to remove highly collinear variables that could reduce computational expense.
